# Overcoming Template Sensitivity of Large Language Models
In the modern era of artificial intelligence, large language models stand
out as extremely powerful tools for processing and analyzing textual data across
various domains, from automated translation to text generation. However, despite
their numerous capabilities, these models exhibit high sensitivity to template
selection, which can lead to significant fluctuations in quality and unreliability of
results. This work examines in detail the issue of template sensitivity in large
language models. We introduce a new approach that significantly reduces this
sensitivity, thereby enhancing the modelsâ€™ robustness. The results of the study
not only confirm a significant improvement in model stability but also open new
perspectives for developing more reliable artificial intelligence systems.
